## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
A security review found two auth gaps. (1) ManavaultWeb.Plugs.GraphQLCSRFProtection only validates the token when the session is marked authenticated, so with MANAVAULT_AUTH_DISABLED=true the check never runs; Absinthe.Plug accepts application/x-www-form-urlencoded bodies with a query field, and a throwaway test proved a cross-origin form POST to /api/graphql with no token returned 200 and created a deck. (2) The cookie session stores only manavault_authenticated: true for up to 180 days, so rotating MANAVAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH or logging out on one device never invalidates a captured cookie; only rotating SECRET_KEY_BASE does. The existing test/manavault_web/graphql_csrf_protection_test.exs forces auth_disabled false, which is why (1) was not caught. Do not modify lib/manavault_web/controllers/auth_controller.ex; another task is moving its HTML into templates.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 A POST to /api/graphql without a valid CSRF token is rejected with 403 when auth is disabled, covered by an ExUnit test that sends a form-encoded body
- [ ] #2 The SPA continues to work with auth disabled because it always sends the meta csrf token
- [ ] #3 Signing in stores a fingerprint derived from the current admin password hash in the session, and changing the hash makes existing sessions unauthenticated for both HTTP requests and the /socket websocket connect, covered by tests
- [ ] #4 Logout drops the whole session rather than deleting one key
- [ ] #5 mix test passes
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Make the private GraphQL pipeline reject every POST lacking a valid session-backed CSRF token, and add an auth-disabled form-post regression test.
2. Derive a stable truncated SHA-256 fingerprint from the configured owner password hash, persist it at sign-in, and require it with the authenticated flag for HTTP and socket sessions.
3. Drop the complete session at logout and add HTTP/socket/logout regression coverage.
4. Run targeted tests, the full ExUnit suite, and exercise a CSRF-bearing GraphQL mutation through the auth-disabled development SPA.
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented unconditional private GraphQL CSRF validation plus an auth-disabled form-post regression test. Added a 128-bit URL-safe SHA-256 fingerprint of the configured admin password hash, stored it during session renewal, and made HTTP and socket authentication require both the flag and matching fingerprint. Logout now drops the complete session; focused auth/CSRF/socket tests pass (31 tests).
