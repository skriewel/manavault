# Development

ManaVault is a Phoenix application with a Vite/React frontend and optional
Capacitor native shells. Tool versions are pinned in `mise.toml`.

## Requirements

- `mise`
- a platform that can run Elixir, Node, and SQLite
- macOS with Xcode only when building/running the iOS shell

## Setup

Install the pinned toolchain, JavaScript dependencies, Elixir dependencies,
database, and assets:

```sh
mise run setup
```

Start Phoenix:

```sh
mise run dev
```

Visit <http://localhost:4000>.

Health check:

```sh
curl http://localhost:4000/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```

## Tests and Checks

Run the Elixir test suite:

```sh
mise run test
```

Run the fuller local precommit suite:

```sh
mise run precommit
```

Useful frontend commands:

```sh
aube run typecheck
aube run test:react
aube run build
```

Audit dependencies for known advisories:

```sh
mix hex.audit
aube audit
```

`mix hex.audit` also runs as part of `precommit`. Transitive JavaScript
packages that upstream has not bumped yet are pinned through the `overrides`
block in `package.json`; drop an override once `aube why <package>` shows every
dependant already requires a fixed version. `aube audit` reports vite
advisories against `vite@0.3.x`: that entry is `vite-plus` aliasing
`@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-core` as `vite`, not the real Vite package, so those
findings are false positives (the real `vite` stays on the version declared in
`package.json`).

GraphQL TypeScript artifacts are generated from `codegen.ts`:

```sh
aube run codegen
```

`aube run codegen` first dumps the Absinthe schema to
`_build/graphql-schema.graphql` with `mix absinthe.schema.sdl`, then runs
`graphql-codegen` against that file, so it does not need a running server.
Introspecting a live server does not work: every `/api/graphql` POST requires a
CSRF token, including in `MANAVAULT_AUTH_DISABLED=true` mode. Set
`GRAPHQL_SCHEMA_URL` to another SDL or JSON schema file to override the source.
Commit the regenerated files under `assets/react/src/gql/`.

## Native Shell Development

Install JavaScript dependencies and sync Capacitor native projects:

```sh
mise run setup:native
```

Android uses the project-local Java and Android SDK toolchains declared in
`mise.toml`. Accept licenses and install SDK packages needed by Capacitor and
native-run:

```sh
mise run setup:android-sdk
```

Build, run, or open Android:

```sh
mise run android:build
mise run android:run
mise run android:open
```

The Android tasks sync the web/native metadata before building or running.

Sync or open iOS from macOS:

```sh
mise run ios:sync
mise run ios:open
```

The iOS project is checked into the repo and syncs from the same web assets, but
building or running requires Xcode.

## Release Helper

Release commands are documented in [releasing.md](releasing.md). The short form
is:

```sh
mise run changelog -- patch
mise run release -- patch
```

Use `minor` or `major` instead of `patch` when the version bump requires it.
